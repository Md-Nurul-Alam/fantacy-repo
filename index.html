When you travel by bike, you can savour freedom. You’re free to move and free from time constraints. You can sleep where you want (as long as you brought your tent), follow your own rhythm and listen to your body. Just because you’ve added a certain stop to your list doesn’t mean you have to stay there or even go there at all. The freedom you feel on a bike trip is endless.

            <h4>Maldives Travel</h4>
            You've seen photos of the Maldives before: picture-perfect private villas suspended over striking blue waters, alabaster white sand beaches and spectacular sunsets dipping into the horizon. The scenic beauty of the Maldives is something to behold, something you can't quite understand until you're there in person

            The island nation of the Maldives is popular with honeymooners looking for seclusion and adventurers looking to explore the depths of the sea on a scuba diving or snorkeling excursion. If you don't fall into either category, consider that the Maldives' appeal has broadened in recent years.
