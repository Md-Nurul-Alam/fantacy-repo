When you travel by bike, you can savour freedom. You’re free to move and free from time constraints. You can sleep where you want (as long as you brought your tent), follow your own rhythm and listen to your body. Just because you’ve added a certain stop to your list doesn’t mean you have to stay there or even go there at all. The freedom you feel on a bike trip is endless.
